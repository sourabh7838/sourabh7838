### 🛠️ Notable Projects


 Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🎮 **Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Reinforcement Learning** | Implemented a self-learning agent using Q-learning to master Tic-Tac-Toe from scratch. Integrated a Tkinter GUI for user interaction and live training visualization. |
| ⚙️ **Incident Automation System** | Flask-based ML automation platform that analyzes and predicts incident categories and resolutions. Integrated auto-remediation logic for high-frequency tickets—cutting resolution time drastically. |
| 📈 **Stock Price Forecasting** | Used LSTM and GRU models to predict short-term stock movements. Evaluated results using MAE/MSE and visualized trends to compare deep learning performance on time-series data. |
| 💬 **Smart Chatbot with NLP & RAG** | Built a context-aware chatbot integrating BERT embeddings, keyword extraction (RAKE), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Tuned for enterprise support queries. |
| 🔍 **Video Transcript Search Engine** | Extracted text using Whisper ASR, then applied YAKE + NMF + TF-IDF to enable semantic search over large video lecture datasets. Supports fast query-based retrieval via Flask API. |
| 🧠 **AI Interview Coach** | Developed a GPT-based interview practice app that generates behavioral and technical questions based on a resume or job description and gives dynamic feedback. |
| 🔎 **AI Resume Analyzer** | Built a Python tool that parses resumes using spaCy and matches them to job descriptions using semantic similarity, ranking candidates for recruiters. |
| 🛍️ **Sales Forecasting Engine** | Machine learning model (XGBoost + engineered features) trained on retail data, deployed to AWS SageMaker with A/B testing and model versioning for robustness. |
| 📊 **Monitoring Dashboard** | Real-time system performance dashboard using Kubernetes + Prometheus + Grafana to track microservice health. Enabled predictive failure alerts based on thresholds and patterns. |
| 🛒 **Retail Analytics Dashboard (BI)** | Created with Power BI to visualize sales trends, regional KPIs, and customer segments. Supported real-time filtering for business stakeholders. |
| 📲 **Personal Organizer Mobile App** *(Flutter)* | A feature-rich to-do and task manager with custom widgets, deadline reminders, and theme switching. Built with Dart and Firebase for cross-device sync. |
| 🧳 **Job Seeker Portfolio App** *(React Native + SQLite)* | Developed using Expo CLI. Allows users to add/update job profiles, attach resumes, and track job applications locally. Designed with a minimal UX and persistent local storage. |
| 🛍️ **Mobile Shopping App** *(Flutter)* | A modern e-commerce UI with product filtering (Clothing, Grocery, Services), cart animation, payment options, and customer reviews. Features smooth animations and gesture support. |
| 🎮 **Space Shooting Game** *(Flutter)* | fast-paced, retro-style space combat game created using Flutter and the Flame game engine. It challenges players to navigate waves of enemies, collect game-altering power-ups, and survive increasingly difficult stages.
